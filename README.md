# PyBank and PyPoll:
*Homework for module 3 python*

## For the PyBank project, the objective was to make a Python script capable of analyzing financial data from the Pybank dataset:
### Findings:
  1. The coding found key metrics, including the total number of months included in the dataset, the net total amount of profits or losses over the entire period, the changes in profits or losses over the entire period along with their average, and increase/decrease.
  2.  The analysis made by the script found these results.
## For the PyPoll project I developed a Python script to process data and calculate several metrics.
### Findings:
  1. These metrics included determining the total number of votes cast, making list of candidates who received votes, calculating the percentage of votes each candidate won, finding the total number of votes received by each candidate, and finding the winner of the election based on the popular vote.
